* Quick-and-dirty-org-agenda 
/(work in progress)/

** WTF is this
Quickly extract TODOs
- [x] fast: without having to fire up a hefty emacs process
- [x] by tag (if given)
- [-] sorted by priority
      TODO: enforce [#n] at top of list over items which have no priority
- [ ] +filter out DONE, FAIL, PURG(atory) etc statuses+
   (redundant)

** Assumptions
/(based on my own config)/
- org agenda files are all *.org files in ~/org and not more than one level deep
- edit to your own taste, particularly you might want to set your own ~todo_states~

** Requirements
- Bash v5+

** Usage
#+begin_src 
quick-and-dirty-org-agenda [TAG_1] [TAG_2] .. [TAG_n]
#+end_src

where ~TAGs~ are optional
